these are more "advanced" tutorials on how to use my html5 game engine.

the numbered html files are the tutorials chapters.open them using your browser.

each chapter has a finished project folder with all the code used in the tut.
the finished projects are also numbered the same as the html files.

16 and 17 are examples, i will create a more detailed tutorial on tilemaps in the future.

the basic tuts are here:
